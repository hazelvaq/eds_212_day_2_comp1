## Derivatives in R

Define a function with capital D(function,'with respect to variable')

```{r}
# expressions are rarely used in R
fx <- expression(3.1*x^4 - 28*x)

df_dx <- D(fx,'x')

df_dx

#What is the slope of the function when x = 10
x<-10

# Evaluate the derivative at x=10
eval(df_dx)

```

##Practice Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ -10.5z\^2 + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gz = expression(2*(z^3) - 10.5*(z^2) +4.1)

dg_gz = D(gz,'z')

dg_gz

z = 3.6
eval(dg_gz)

#sequence evaluate

z = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)
eval(dg_gz)
```
